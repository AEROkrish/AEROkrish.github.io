I am currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at IIT Bombay. Before joining here, I was a postdoc researcher at Ecole Polytechnique [LMS], France. My research focus was on electro-mechanical coupling for Liquid Crystal system and its stability analysis. Before joining at LMS, I was a researcher at the Institute of Mechanics at TU Dortmund, Germany. I worked there on modeling and simulation of Magneto-Active Polymers. I graduated from the Department of Aerospace Engineering, Texas A&M University, USA. My Ph.D. research topic was on modeling of electro-magneto-thermo-mechanical coupling of Magnetic Shape Memory Alloys. I received my Master's degree (Aero) from IIT-Kanpur and Bachelor's degree (Mech) from Jadavpur University.
