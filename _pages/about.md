I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at IIT Bombay. Before joining IIT Bombay, I was a postdoc researcher at <a href='https://portail.polytechnique.edu/lms/en/lms/overview'> Ecole Polytechnique (LMS) </a>, France. My research focused on electro-mechanical coupling for the Liquid Crystal system and its stability analysis. Before joining LMS, I was a researcher at the <a href='https://im.mb.tu-dortmund.de/'> Institute of Mechanics </a> at TU Dortmund, Germany. I worked there on the modeling and simulation of Magneto-Active Polymers. I graduated from the <a href='https://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/home/'>Department of Aerospace Engineering, Texas A&M University</a> , USA. My Ph.D. research topic was modeling electro-magneto-thermo-mechanical coupling of Magnetic Shape Memory Alloys. I received my Master's degree (Aerospace) from <a href='https://www.iitk.ac.in/aero/?view=featured'>IIT Kanpur</a> and my Bachelor's (Mechanical) from <a href='https://jadavpuruniversity.in/academics/mechanical-engineering/'>Jadavpur University</a>.
