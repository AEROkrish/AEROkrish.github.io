I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at IIT Bombay. Before joining IIT Bombay, I was a postdoc researcher at Ecole Polytechnique [LMS], France. My research focused on electro-mechanical coupling for the Liquid Crystal system and its stability analysis. Before joining LMS, I was a researcher at the Institute of Mechanics at TU Dortmund, Germany. I worked there on the modeling and simulation of Magneto-Active Polymers. I graduated from the Department of Aerospace Engineering, Texas A&M University, USA. My Ph.D. research topic was modeling electro-magneto-thermo-mechanical coupling of Magnetic Shape Memory Alloys. I received my Master's degree (Aerospace) from IIT Kanpur and my Bachelor's (Mechanical) from Jadavpur University.

My research interests are continuum mechanics of solids and electromagnetic coupling, modeling and simulation of multi-functional material systems, experiments, and some biomechanics.
