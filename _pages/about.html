--- I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at IIT Bombay. Before joining IIT Bombay, I was a postdoc researcher at Ecole Polytechnique [LMS], France. My research focused on electro-mechanical coupling for the Liquid Crystal system and its stability analysis. Before joining LMS, I was a researcher at the Institute of Mechanics at TU Dortmund, Germany. I worked there on the modeling and simulation of Magneto-Active Polymers. I graduated from the Department of Aerospace Engineering, Texas A&amp;M University, USA. My Ph.D. research topic was modeling electro-magneto-thermo-mechanical coupling of Magnetic Shape Memory Alloys. I received my Master's degree (Aerospace) from IIT Kanpur and my Bachelor's (Mechanical) from Jadavpur University.
